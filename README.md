## ℹ️ What is it?

My Personal Website serves as my technical portfolio for anyone interested in learning about my skills in computer science. It presents my technical strengths, strongest programming skills, software projects, work experience, and contact information. I created it to be able to not only talk about my strengths, but to display them! Be sure to visit it to learn more about me!

## 💻 Technologies

This site is structured completely in HTML and styles entirely in CSS. Additionally, Adobe Illustrator was used to design and generate every "card" element seen on the site.

TL;DR:

- HTML
- CSS
- Adobe Illustrator
